<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m Jeremy Liu, a Computer Engineering Undergraduate at the University of
  Toronto, and I’m passionate about encouraging people to live life to their
  fullest potential and to create inspiring learning environments. Right now,
  I’m working on building my own website and managing time for my
  extracurriculars. What drives me in life is to experience life fully with
  other people, and inspire others to do great things.
